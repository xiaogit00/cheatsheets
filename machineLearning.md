## scikit-learn

__Transformers__ is a term used for classes in `scikit-learn` (or `sklearn`) that enable data transformations. `scikit-learn` provides a library of transformers, which may _clean_ (for preprocessing), _reduce_ (for unsupervised dimensionality reduction), _expand_ (for kernel approximation) or _generate_ (for feature extraction) feature representations.

`from sklearn import preprocessing`
